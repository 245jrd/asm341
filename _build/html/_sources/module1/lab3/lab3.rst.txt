----------------------------------------

.. |lab3-1| image:: images/lab3-1.png

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we're going to all this trouble to build a tight WAF policy, why do we now want to override it?  There can be several reasons an organization wants to enforce security policy except for specific users (IPs).  These reasons include:

        - Testing a new version of the Application
        - Penetration testing
        - Automated Scanning and patching tools


As the defined hostnames will be able to completely bypass security policy it's important to protect the bypass hostnames.
